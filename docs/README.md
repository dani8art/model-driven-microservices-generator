# Model Driven Microservices Generator MDMG

The idea of this project borns from the problem of kubernetize (deploy apps
on kubernetes) microservice applications. Main problem of kubernetize apps is
create or define the files which are necessary to deploy apps on kubernetes,
becouse its are normaly a lots and sometime the concepts and the configuration
that are reflected on these files is out of our knowledge.

On this project we will use the Model-driven software engineering for abstracting the
problem to a easier model that permits to describe apps, and after, we will generate
all necessary files.  

In this documentation you can find concepts, meta-models, models, etc which are been
uses for developing the tool.
